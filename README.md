# Titanic

Here is my most recent submission to the Kaggle Titanic competition.

My best score for this competition is 900/13454 at the time of submission, which is among the top ~7% of entrants.

The uploaded code has some additional feature engineering and is not my best entry performance wise, but I believe it's my most complete notebook.

The uploaded csv are the results of my best performing entry.
